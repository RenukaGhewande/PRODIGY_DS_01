# Task 01 – Data Visualization

## Objective
To perform basic data visualization by creating a bar graph or histogram to understand the distribution of a variable using Python.

## Description
In this task, a real-world CSV dataset was loaded using the Pandas library.
The dataset contains population data for different countries across multiple years.

A bar graph was created to visualize the population distribution of the top 10 countries for a selected year (2020).
This visualization helps in understanding how population varies across countries.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Outcome
Successfully created a clear and informative bar graph representing population distribution using a CSV dataset.
This task helped strengthen understanding of data handling and visualization techniques.
